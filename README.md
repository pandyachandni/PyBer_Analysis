# PyBer_Analysis
1. Overview of the analysis
The goal of this challenge is to give PyBer ridesharing data visualizations so they are able to help unprivileged communities to help determine costs.

1. Total Fare by City Type

The chart above shows the amount of money made by the service which is steady from January to May. Urban cities generated the most total revenue then by suburban/rural locations. Comparing urban and suburban cities, the average connection is 2:1 and while the same relationship between urban and rural cities is 9:1. This image does not show cost of service. As shown the relationship makes sense because there are more people that use the app/line in the city than the suburbs.

2. Summary Dataframe by City Type
PyBer Summary Dataframe

The figures show that there is a huge gap in riders from the cities and suburban/rural ones. The amount of drivers in urban areas are more plentiful than suburban(5 times more) and rural(31 times more) areas. Looking at the income created, the Average Fare per Ride is 20% lower in urban cities than suburban, and 30% lower in urban cities versus rural.

Rural drivers outperform Suburban and Urban drivers in terms of Average Fare per Driver. The ratio is 3.3:1 for rural vs. urban, and 2.4:1 for suburban vs. urban.

Conclusions
Urban cities generate the most revenue for PyBer
Customers in Urban cities pay less per ride so drivers earn less per ride
Rural areas look like they are underserved and customers in those areas pay expensive fares than in Urban/Suburban cities
3. Summary: 
Based on what we found there are three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
1. Repeat this study for an entire year to see a full trend.
2. Since rural areas are abit unserved, there should be a study to see if there is indeed a demand and a need to hire more drivers.
3. Based on the relationship of Urban cities of 2405 Drivers/1625 Rides = 1.48 Drivers/Ride, the total number of drivers in Rural areas shold be increased at least to 185 (78 drivers * 1.48 = 185 drivers), but this increase has to be supported by a market study, as explained in #2.
